## 1. AT A GLANCE

**Question:** "What does this person think about Donald Trump?"
**Sentiment:** Strongly Positive / Strategic Ally
**Short Answer:** Rabois views Trump as a vital "Founder Mode" disruptor necessary for dismantling the "woke" administrative state, restoring meritocracy, and securing Israeli interests through hawkish foreign policy.
**Conviction Level:** Firm
**Confidence:** High — His alignment with Trump’s inner circle, policy architects, and the "New Right" intellectual vanguard is comprehensive and public.

**Key Drivers:**
*   **Institutional Disruption:** He sees Trump as the only force capable of breaking the "managerial class" and bureaucratic drift in D.C.
*   **Pro-Israel Hawkishness:** Deep alignment with the Trump-Kushner approach to the Middle East and the Abraham Accords.
*   **Anti-Woke Crusade:** Aligns with Trump on dismantling DEI and progressive capture of universities and corporations.
*   **Regulatory Efficiency:** Strong supporter of the Musk-Trump "DOGE" initiative to gut federal agencies.

## 2. SIMULATED RESPONSE

"Look, you have to stop looking at Trump through the lens of 'personality' and start looking at him through the lens of 'agency.' In Silicon Valley, we talk about 'Founder Mode'—the idea that a leader needs to bypass layers of stagnant bureaucracy to actually get things done. That is exactly what Trump represents for the United States. 

The reality is that our core institutions—the universities, the federal agencies, the legacy media—have been captured by a 'managerial class' that prioritizes ideological conformity over merit and competence. When I moved from San Francisco to Miami, it wasn't just about the weather; it was a rejection of the failed progressive consensus that is literally destroying American cities. Trump is the only person in the arena actually willing to break those structures.

If you look at his record, especially in the Middle East, the Abraham Accords were the most significant geopolitical breakthrough in decades. Why? Because he ignored the 'experts' at the State Department who had been failing for forty years. He understands that strength and clarity are what drive results. 

I’m closely aligned with the people who are actually building the next iteration of the government—folks like Chris Rufo on the cultural front and the DOGE orbit on the efficiency front. We need a government that operates with the speed of a high-growth startup, not a sclerotic post office. Trump is the catalyst for that disruption. You don't have to like every tweet to recognize that the alternative is a slow, managed decline into mediocrity."

## 3. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**What we're most sure about:**
*   **Strategic Alignment:** Rabois is deeply embedded in the Project 2025 and "New Right" intellectual ecosystem. His affinity for figures like Christopher Rufo and Russ Vought makes his policy alignment undeniable.
*   **Geopolitical Drivers:** His fierce Zionism is a primary driver. He views the Trump administration's Middle East policy as the gold standard for Israeli security.
*   **Anti-Institutionalism:** His move to Miami and his constant critiques of "woke" capture align perfectly with the Trumpian "Drain the Swamp" narrative.

**Probable but less certain:**
*   **Personal Rapport:** While he is plugged into the inner circle (Kushner, Miller, Leavitt), it’s probable he views Trump more as a tactical "weapon" for his preferred outcomes rather than a personal idol.

**Educated guesses:**
*   **Economic Specifics:** While he supports deregulation, his specific stance on Trump’s protectionist trade tariffs might be more nuanced given his background in global venture capital, though he likely accepts them as part of a broader "China Hawk" strategy.

**Blind spots:**
*   **Private Critiques:** Data cannot reveal if he has private reservations about Trump’s populist rhetoric regarding the working class, which sometimes conflicts with elite venture capital interests.

## 4. INTELLIGENCE BRIEF

**Direct Connections:**
*   **The Inner Circle:** Rabois is closely connected to the Trump administration’s operational core, showing strong engagement with Jared Kushner, Jason Miller, and Karoline Leavitt.
*   **The Policy Architects:** He is plugged into the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) orbit through figures like James Burnham and is intellectually aligned with Russ Vought’s vision for executive power.
*   **The Legal Vanguard:** He shows deep affinity for the legal warriors of the movement, including Harmeet Dhillon and former Trump DOJ officials like Chad Mizelle.
*   **Geographic Statement:** His high-profile move from San Francisco to Miami was framed explicitly as a political and cultural exodus from "failed" progressive governance toward the "Free State of Florida" model championed by the Trump-DeSantis wing.

**Contextual Signals:**
*   **PayPal Mafia Ethos:** His worldview is shaped by the PayPal Mafia’s high-agency, contrarian philosophy. This group increasingly views the current "regime" as the primary obstacle to technological and civilizational progress.
*   **The "Great Realignment":** He is a leading figure in the shift of Silicon Valley elite toward the GOP, driven by frustrations with DEI, crime in tech hubs, and regulatory overreach (FTC/SEC).
*   **Hawkish Zionism:** He is a fierce advocate for Israel and gravitates toward the "Peace through Strength" foreign policy circle that characterized the Trump White House.

**Inferred Leanings:**
*   **Meritocracy Maximalist:** He views "wokeness" and DEI as existential threats to American competitiveness. He aligns with Trump’s intent to dismantle these frameworks via executive order.
*   **Anti-Bureaucracy:** As a builder of companies like Opendoor and Square, he has a natural disdain for "middle management." He views the federal bureaucracy as the ultimate "middle management" that needs to be purged.

## 5. PSYCHOGRAPHIC REASONING

Rabois operates from a **"Wartime CEO"** archetype. He believes that in times of institutional rot, you do not need a "manager"; you need a "disruptor." This shapes his entire view of Donald Trump. He doesn't evaluate Trump as a traditional politician, but as a **high-agency founder** tasked with a massive turnaround project.

His value system is rooted in **Merit, Speed, and Sovereignty.** He has zero patience for "consensus" if that consensus leads to stagnation. Because he views the current Democratic establishment as a "regime" of bureaucratic drift and cultural radicalism, he sees Trump as the only logical counter-force. His communication style is blunt and "first principles" based; he respects Trump’s ability to "speak the truth" about institutional failure, even if the delivery is unrefined.

## 6. CONVERSATION PLAYBOOK

**Best way to bring this up:**
*   Frame the conversation around **institutional competence** or **regulatory capture.** Ask him: "Do you think the current administrative state is capable of being reformed from within, or does it need an external shock?"
*   Reference the **Abraham Accords** as a model for "disruptive" foreign policy.

**What they'd engage with:**
*   **DOGE and Efficiency:** He will talk at length about cutting the federal workforce and the Musk-led effort to streamline government.
*   **Campus Radicalism:** He is highly energized by the fight against DEI and the "capture" of elite universities.
*   **The Miami Model:** Discussing why Miami is winning and SF is losing is a guaranteed entry point into his broader political worldview.

**Landmines to avoid:**
*   **Focusing on "Mean Tweets" or Aesthetics:** He views these as low-IQ distractions. If you focus on Trump’s personality rather than his policy results, he will likely dismiss you as "unserious."
*   **Assuming he's a "Traditional" Republican:** He isn't. He has no interest in the old-school, neoconservative GOP. He is a "New Right" populist-elitist.

**Predicted follow-up questions they'd ask YOU:**
*   "Can you name a single legacy institution that has actually improved its output in the last ten years?"
*   "Do you value 'politeness' more than you value the survival of meritocracy?"
