# Tutorial 9: The Anti-Creepy Guide

> **Addresses the objection head-on. Builds trust.**

## What You're Showing

Fine line between "they really did their homework" and "that's creepy." Show a dossier with deep personal insights. Walk through Approach Strategy and Warnings & Landmines. Good vs. bad examples. Framework: reference interests naturally, never quote handles, use insights to guide the conversation not script it.

## Setup Before Recording

- Run deep research on someone ahead of time (have the dossier ready)
- Pick a dossier with rich personal insights (hobbies, social follows, etc.)
- This tutorial is more conversational — less coding, more framework

## Demo Script

### Step 1: Show the Raw Power (and the Risk)

Open a dossier and show the depth:

```
Look at what deep research gives us on [Name]:
- They follow @staborunn on Twitter (ultra-running content)
- They ran a 3:42 marathon last October
- They follow 3 accounts about stoic philosophy
- They have a second Instagram account for their sourdough baking hobby
- They volunteer at [specific nonprofit]
- Their partner works at [company]

This is incredibly powerful intelligence. It's also incredibly easy to misuse. Let me show you the right way to use this.
```

### Step 2: Good vs. Bad — Side by Side

```
Show me 5 examples of GOOD vs. BAD ways to use insights from this dossier. The line between "impressive homework" and "creepy stalker" is thin.
```

Let Claude produce the contrast:

**BAD:**
- "I saw you follow @staborunn and ran a 3:42 marathon last October"
- "Your tweet from January 14th about stoic philosophy really resonated"
- "I noticed your partner works at [company] — small world!"

**GOOD:**
- "I heard you're into running — do you do road or trail?"
- "I've been getting into stoic philosophy lately — any book recommendations?"
- "I think we might have some mutual connections in the [industry] space"

### Step 3: The Framework

```
Based on this dossier, build me an approach guide that uses these insights without being creepy. What's the framework?
```

The framework:
1. **Reference, don't quote** — say "I know you're into cycling" not "I read your Strava profile"
2. **Guide, don't script** — use insights to steer topics, not recite facts
3. **Earn depth over time** — start broad, get specific only after they share first
4. **Never quote handles** — reference interests, not where you found them
5. **The intent test** — would this feel helpful or invasive to the other person?

### Step 4: Walk Through the Dossier's Built-In Guardrails

Show how the dossier itself helps:

**Approach Strategy section:**
```
"This section tells you HOW to use the insights. It's not just 'here's what they like' — it's 'here's what to mention and what to keep to yourself.'"
```

**Warnings & Landmines section:**
```
"This section tells you what NOT to say. The dossier protects you from yourself."
```

### Step 5: Practice the Opener

```
I'm about to meet this person. Using the anti-creepy framework, give me 3 opening lines that use deep research insights WITHOUT revealing how much I know.
```

Show the natural, conversational openers that come from deep knowledge but sound organic.

### Step 6: The Depth Ladder

```
Show me how a conversation evolves using the "earn depth over time" principle. Start with a broad reference and show how I can go deeper as they share.
```

Example:
- You: "I heard you're into running. What kind?"
- Them: "Yeah, I do ultras actually."
- You: "No way — I've been curious about that. What's the longest you've done?"
- (Now you can naturally get into the detail you already knew)

## Punchline

> "The goal isn't to know everything about someone. It's to care enough to try."

## Key Moments to Emphasize

- The raw dossier being impressive but potentially dangerous
- The side-by-side good vs. bad being immediately clear
- The framework being simple and memorable
- The "earn depth over time" principle — showing how knowing everything lets you ask the RIGHT questions
