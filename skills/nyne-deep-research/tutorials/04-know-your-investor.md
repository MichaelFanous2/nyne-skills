# Tutorial 4: Know Your Investor Before the Pitch

> **Flips the VC power dynamic.**

## What You're Showing

VCs research you before a meeting. What if you researched them back — deeper? Run deep research on a well-known VC. Dossier reveals causes they care about, founders they're close to, communication style, weekend hobbies. Build a pitch narrative aligned with their values. Simulate the pitch.

## Setup Before Recording

- Pick a well-known VC partner (someone whose public persona is rich enough for a good demo)
- Have their email and/or LinkedIn URL
- Have a real or realistic startup pitch to use

## Demo Script

### Step 1: Set the Scene

```
I'm pitching [VC name] at [firm] next week. They've already read my deck and talked to references. They know everything about me. But what do I know about them? Their portfolio page and maybe their last tweet. Let me fix that.
```

### Step 2: Run Deep Research on the VC

```
python deep_research.py --email "{vc_email}" --linkedin "{vc_linkedin}" --output vc_dossier.md
```

### Step 3: Walk Through What Changes Your Pitch

**Causes They Care About:**
```
"They volunteer at an education nonprofit. They tweet about founder mental health. They sit on the board of [org]. This isn't in their Crunchbase profile."
```

**Communication Style:**
```
"Data-driven, direct, doesn't tolerate hand-waving. They want numbers, not narratives. I need to lead with metrics, not vision."
```

**Interest Clusters:**
```
"Sports: they coach youth soccer. Culture: jazz and wine. Causes: education equity and climate tech. Weekend hobbies: hiking and cooking."
```

**Key Relationships:**
```
"They're close to [founder] who I know. There's a warm intro angle I didn't see before."
```

**Warnings & Landmines:**
```
"They've publicly criticized companies that scale too fast without unit economics. I was going to pitch our growth rate. I need to reframe around sustainable growth."
```

### Step 4: Build a Values-Aligned Pitch Narrative

```
Based on this dossier, help me rebuild my pitch narrative for this specific investor. I'm building [your product]. How should I frame the story to resonate with their values, communication style, and interests? What should I lead with? What should I avoid?
```

### Step 5: Simulate the Pitch

```
Now become this VC based on the dossier. I'm going to pitch you. Push back where they would push back. Ask the questions they'd actually ask. Flag if I'm heading toward a landmine.

Here's my pitch: [deliver the pitch]
```

Run 5-6 exchanges. Let the simulation:
- Push back on something specific (e.g., "Your burn rate concerns me — what's your path to profitability?")
- Ask a question rooted in their real investment thesis
- Respond to rapport attempts based on actual interests

### Step 6: Debrief

```
Break character. What objections should I prepare for? What angle resonated most? What should my opening 30 seconds sound like?
```

## Punchline

> "Founders are always the ones being evaluated. Not anymore."

## Key Moments to Emphasize

- The dossier revealing the VC's personal causes and values (not just their portfolio thesis)
- The pitch reframe — from generic to values-aligned
- The simulation pushing back in a VC-specific way
- The landmine about scaling too fast being caught before the meeting
