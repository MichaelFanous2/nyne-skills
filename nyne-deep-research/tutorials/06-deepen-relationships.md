# Tutorial 6: Deepen Relationships You Already Have

> **Not just for new contacts — the retention angle.**

## What You're Showing

You've worked with this client for 2 years. How well do you actually know them? Run deep research on an existing contact. Surface surprises: rock climbing, education nonprofit, obscure jazz accounts. New conversation dimensions beyond quarterly reviews. The "Creepy Good Insights" section reveals patterns most people would never find.

## Setup Before Recording

- Pick an existing client, colleague, or contact you've known for a while
- Someone you think you know well (the surprise factor is the demo)
- Have their email/LinkedIn

## Demo Script

### Step 1: Set the Scene

```
I've worked with [Name] for 2 years. We talk every quarter about KPIs and roadmap. But I realized — I don't actually know them. I know their job title and maybe their alma mater. Let me see what I've been missing.
```

### Step 2: Run Deep Research

```
python deep_research.py --email "{email}" --linkedin "{linkedin}" --output existing_contact.md
```

### Step 3: The Surprises

Open the dossier and react genuinely to what you didn't know:

**Personal Life & Hobbies:**
```
"I had no idea they're into bouldering. Two years of meetings and I never knew. They also volunteer at a coding bootcamp for underprivileged kids."
```

**Interest Cluster Deep Dive:**
```
"Look at this — they follow 15 jazz accounts. Not just mainstream jazz — obscure avant-garde stuff. They're also into craft coffee and follow 8 specialty roasters. None of this has ever come up."
```

**"Creepy Good" Insights:**
```
"They follow 3 accounts related to stoic philosophy. They've liked posts about burnout recovery. They follow a parenting podcast about raising kids in tech families. This is a whole person I've never met."
```

**Key Relationships:**
```
"They're connected to [person I know]. That's a shared connection I could've leveraged a year ago."
```

### Step 4: New Conversation Dimensions

```
Based on this dossier, give me 5 ways I can deepen this relationship beyond our quarterly business reviews. What should I bring up naturally? What small gestures would show I care?
```

Show the contrast:

**Before (every meeting):**
```
"So how's Q3 tracking? Any blockers on the integration?"
```

**After (next meeting):**
```
"Before we dive in — I just started bouldering and I'm terrible at it. Someone told me you climb. Any tips for a beginner?"
```

### Step 5: Thoughtful Gestures

```
Based on their interests, suggest 3 small, thoughtful gestures I could do in the next month that would show genuine interest without being creepy.
```

Examples Claude might suggest:
- Share an article about a jazz artist they follow
- Send a book recommendation aligned with their stoic philosophy interest
- Mention a climbing gym when you're in their city

## Punchline

> "The best relationships aren't built in meetings. They're built in the moments between."

## Key Moments to Emphasize

- The genuine surprise at discovering interests you never knew about
- The depth of the Interest Cluster section — not just "likes sports" but specific handles and patterns
- The "Creepy Good" insights that reveal deeper personality traits
- The shift from transactional quarterly reviews to genuine human connection
