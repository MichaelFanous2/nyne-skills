## 1. AT A GLANCE

**Question:** "What is his favorite sock brand?"
**Sentiment:** Insufficient Data
**Short Answer:** We don't have enough direct signal to identify a specific "favorite" sock brand for Keith Rabois with high confidence.
**Conviction Level:** Unknown
**Confidence:** Insufficient Data — While his lifestyle and social graph provide strong clues about his gear requirements, he has not publicly named or engaged with a specific sock brand in the provided data.

**What we looked for but didn't find:**
- Direct mentions of sock brands in his social posts or newsfeed.
- Specific brand follows for major players like Darn Tough, Stance, Bombas, or Smartwool.
- Apparel-focused "gear lists" or biohacking protocols that specify hosiery.

**What we CAN say:**
- **Performance over Fashion:** Rabois is deeply embedded in the "Human Optimization" and biohacking communities (following figures like Gary Brecka and Bryan Johnson). He is unlikely to wear novelty or "fun" socks; he would prioritize moisture-wicking, compression, and metabolic efficiency.
- **The Ultramarathon Connection:** He follows serious endurance athletes and ultramarathoners, such as Kevin Weil and Mike Alfred. In these circles, socks are viewed as critical equipment. This suggests a likely preference for high-performance technical brands like **Darn Tough** (for durability and its "Buy It For Life" ethos) or **Injinji/Balega** (for athletic performance).
- **DTC Awareness:** Given his deep connections to the Shopify and DTC ecosystems (following Eli Weiss and Nik Sharma), he is undoubtedly aware of the unit economics and engineering behind brands like **Bombas**, which fits his "tech-chic" Miami lifestyle.
- **The "Miami Uniform":** His move to Miami and his engagement with high-end fitness experts suggest a preference for technical, athletic-leaning apparel, often associated with brands like **Lululemon** or **Nike Elite**.

**How to find out:**
- Check his recent workout or "Founder Mode" photos on Instagram for visible branding.
- Look for his interviews regarding "DTC excellence," where he often cites specific brands as examples of high-retention business models.
- Ask him about his "travel stack" for long-haul flights; he likely has a specific compression sock preference for biological optimization during travel.
