# Tutorial 3: The 5-Minute Prep That Changes Everything

> **The accessible entry point — everyone relates to this.**

## What You're Showing

You have a meeting in 5 minutes. One command. Dossier comes back. Walk through Personal Life & Hobbies, Interest Clusters, and Conversation Starters. Before/after: generic opener vs. personalized opener. Completely different energy.

## Setup Before Recording

- Pick someone you'd realistically be meeting (client, prospect, investor, candidate)
- Have just their email ready (mimicking the "I only have 5 minutes" scenario)
- Time yourself — the demo should feel fast

## Demo Script

### Step 1: The Scenario

```
I have a meeting with someone in 5 minutes. All I have is their email: {email}. I know nothing else about them. Let me run deep research real quick.
```

### Step 2: Kick Off Deep Research

```
python deep_research.py --email "{email}" --output dossier.md
```

As it runs, narrate the speed:
- "Enriching... gathering social profiles... analyzing..."
- "This takes about 30-60 seconds."

### Step 3: Walk Through What Matters in 5 Minutes

Open the dossier. Skip to the sections that matter when you're short on time:

**Personal Life & Hobbies:**
```
"OK — they're training for their first triathlon, they do weekend woodworking, they have two kids and coach little league on Saturdays. I didn't know any of this."
```

**Interest Clusters:**
```
"Sports: cycling, triathlon training. Culture: jazz, craft beer. Causes: education equity. This tells me who they are beyond their job title."
```

**Conversation Starters (30+):**
```
"These are gold. Look at this:
- 'How's the triathlon training going? I heard the swim is the hardest part.'
- 'I noticed you're into woodworking — built anything lately?'
- 'Your take on the remote work debate was interesting.'

Any one of these opens a real conversation."
```

**Warnings & Landmines:**
```
"Don't bring up [topic]. They've posted negatively about [thing]. Good to know."
```

### Step 4: The Before/After

Show the contrast:

```
Without deep research, my opening line would be:
"Thanks for taking the time, excited to connect and learn more about what you're working on."

WITH deep research, my opening line is:
"I saw you're training for your first triathlon — how's the swim coming along? I did one last year and the open water swim was the scariest part."

Same meeting. Completely different energy.
```

### Step 5: Quick Approach Strategy

```
Give me a 30-second approach strategy for this meeting based on the dossier. What should I lead with, what should I avoid, and what's the best rapport angle?
```

## Punchline

> "5 minutes of prep. Completely different energy in the room."

## Key Moments to Emphasize

- The speed — one command, results in under a minute
- The Personal Life section revealing things you'd never find from googling
- The Conversation Starters being immediately usable
- The before/after contrast of generic vs. personalized openers
